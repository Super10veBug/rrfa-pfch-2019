This project, created during the Programming for Cultural Heritage course at Pratt Institute iSchool, was designed in response to the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation’s Archives (RRFA) request for a CSV formatted finding aid to facilitate shipping of materials for digitization and storage.

The EAD XML finding aid used for this conversion is an export from ArchivesSpace. The finding aids are selections from collections RRFA01 – Rauschenberg Papers and RRFA02 – Audiovisual.

My purpose was to supply RRFA with a reusable script, and to include instructions that can be followed by the archivists and future interns at the Rauschenberg Foundation. I provided two forms of documented instructions. The first is code in .py files in the Github; those titles begin with "instructions_". The second documented instruction is the slideshow, which is saved in .pdf and .pptx. 

There are versions of the code available without instructions which begin with "clean_" which can be used, with minor adjustments, for different series or collections.
